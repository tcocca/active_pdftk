= PdftkForms

This gem is intended to be a wrapper for the PDFTK command line utility for working with pdfs, mainly editable pdfs.

Currently this gem is intended to make the following much easier with pdftk:
  1. Perform all operations provided by PDFTK (burst, cat, ....).
  2. Making pdf forms reading & filling easy.
  3. Get all the form fields details (type, readonly, ...) in a structured way to use them within other frameworks (such as Rails).
  4. More to come through specifics adapters...

== Props

Props to this gem go out to jkraemer (Jens KrÃ¤mer) for creating https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms and devfu (Dev Fu!) for creating https://github.com/devfu/pdftk.

This gem is based on the work of those two projects and expands upon their functionality.

== Installation

You must have PDFTK binary installed :

https://github.com/tcocca/pdftk_forms/wiki/Install-pdftk

Or directly :

http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit

then install the gem:

  gem install pdftk_forms

or with Bundler :

  gem 'pdftk_forms'

or in a old rails 2.3.x app

  config.gem 'pdftk_forms'

== Usage

PDFTK provide all kind of operations (See below for a full list).
Depending of your needs you will use different Adapters.

For form handling use +PdftkForms::Form+ :

  bic = PdftkForms::Form.new('bic.pdf')
  bic.set('first_field', 'SomeString') #=> 'SomeString'
  bic.save #=> 'bic_filled.pdf'

it is quite straightforward !

For read/write metadata on a pdf file use +PdftkForms::Metadata+ (coming soon).

for other needs you will use +PdftkForms::Wrapper+ to access all operations of PDFTK.

if you want to digg deeper check +PdftkForms::Call+ which build the command line from an options hash.

=== PdftkForms::Wrapper

This is the class you will interact with for all operations.
The class will discover your 'pdftk' library (works on all *nix systems), but you can optionally give a path to the binary :

  @pdftk = PdftkForms::Wrapper.new
  @pdftk.path # => 'etc/bin/pdftk'

OR

  @pdftk = PdftkForms::Wrapper.new(:path => '/usr/local/bin/pdftk')
  @pdftk.path # => '/usr/local/bin/pdftk'

Then all operations are available :

  @pdftk.cat([{:pdf => 'a.pdf', :pass => 'foo'}, {:pdf => 'b.pdf', :start => 1, :end => 'end', :orientation => 'N', :pages => 'even'}])
  @pdftk.burst('in1.pdf')
  @pdftk.dump_data_fields('~/Desktop/a.pdf', :output => '~/Desktop/data_fields.txt')
  ...

Other operations are :

    cat (partially supported)
    shuffle (partially supported)
    burst (fully supported)
    generate_fdf (fully supported) (this operation doesn't always provide readable FDF, we support this feature by our means)
    fill_form (fully supported)
    background (fully supported)
    multibackground (fully supported)
    stamp (fully supported)
    multistamp (fully supported)
    dump_data (fully supported)
    dump_data_utf8 (fully supported)
    dump_data_fields (fully supported)
    dump_data_fields_utf8 (fully supported)
    update_info (fully supported)
    update_info_utf8 (fully supported)
    attach_files (partially supported)
    unpack_files (fully supported)

=== The Domain Specific Language

All operations & options are available through a hash corresponding to a DSL.
A full explanation of this DSL could be read in +PdftkForms::Call+ reference.

#TODO write a more explicit, but concise paragraph.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
